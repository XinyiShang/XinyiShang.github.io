## Projects

### Dynamical Synaptic Strengths and its Effect on the Discrimination of Sequential Stimuli

#### Senior Thesis
#### Advisor: Prof. Paul Miller | 06/2022 - 05/2023

- Conducted a study on the effect of short-term synaptic plasticity on the discrimination of different stimuli sequences within a randomly connected attractor network.
- Utilized a computational neuroscience model for analysis.
- Employed clustering and confusion matrix techniques to investigate the network's ability to discriminate with various parameter sets.
- Results demonstrated that the presence of facilitation increased network stability, while depression enhanced sensitivity to different signals. The network with both facilitation and depression exhibited the most complex behavior.

### Improve the network performance based on “Pruning Filters for Efficient ConvNets”	
#### Course Project
#### Advisor: Prof. Hongfu Liu | 04/2023-05/2023

- Implemented the network from the paper by Hao Li et al., focusing on pruning of filters with the smallest weight to improve computational efficiency and reduce model size
- Explored the transition from VGG16 to VGG19 architectures, and introduced Dropout regulation to VGG16 model, resulting in nominal improvements
- Employed quantization methods to decrease the size of the VGG16 model while maintaining accuracy levels, but still have difficulties in assessing the pruned network's accuracy
